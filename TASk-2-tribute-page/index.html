                    <h3>Biography</h3><br><br>
                    <p>Bhagat Singh was an influential Indian revolutionary and freedom fighter who played a
                        significant role in India's struggle for independence from British rule. Born on September 28,
                        1907,
                        in Banga, Punjab, British India (now in Pakistan), he was deeply inspired by nationalist
                        movements
                        and the desire to end colonial rule.

                        Bhagat Singh became involved in revolutionary activities at a
                        young age and was a prominent member of groups like the Hindustan Socialist
                        Republican Association (HSRA). He is best known for his dramatic acts against the British,
                        including:

                        In 1931, at just 23 years old, Bhagat Singh was executed by hanging,
                        along with his associates Rajguru and Sukhdev, for his revolutionary actions.
                        His martyrdom turned him into a symbol of heroism and patriotism,
                        inspiring future generations in India’s quest for freedom.</p>
